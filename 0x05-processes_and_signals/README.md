Processes and signals

Description - In Unix-like operating systems, a process is an instance of a running program. Each process has its own unique process ID (PID) and memory space. Processes are managed by the operating system's kernel, which schedules them for execution, allocates resources, and ensures their proper functioning. 

This project provides an overview of processes and signals in Unix-like operating systems. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing robust and efficient software that interacts with the operating system environment effectively.
