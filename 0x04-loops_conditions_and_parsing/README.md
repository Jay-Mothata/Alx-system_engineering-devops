Loops, conditions and parsing

Description - Loops and conditions are fundamental constructs in programming languages, allowing the execution of code repeatedly and selectively based on certain conditions. Parsing involves analyzing and interpreting strings or data to extract relevant information. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing efficient and effective software solutions.

This project aims to provide clear examples and explanations of loops, conditions, and parsing.
