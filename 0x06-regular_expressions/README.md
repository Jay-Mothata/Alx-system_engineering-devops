Regular Expression

Description - Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex, provide a powerful and flexible means of matching patterns in text. This project serves as a guide to understanding and utilizing regular expressions effectively.

What are Regular Expressions?
Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are widely used in text processing tasks such as search and replace, validation, and data extraction. Regular expressions can match various combinations of characters, making them extremely versatile for handling different types of textual data.

For this project, you have to build your regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.
